We are avid meat eaters, but these vegetarian tacos are one of our go-tos in Peru. If you can make the pickles with Peruvian aji amarillo, please do.

Roast cauliflower
Pickled chilis and vegetables
Caramelized red onions
Guacamole
Yogurt
Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan

To make an amazing taco, elbow's oil is needed, like any other creation you make in your life.
Elbow's oil can be extracted from anyone' elbow. Every oil will have a different taste, depending on how much hard work was put in the preparation of the taco.
The oil must be added at the end before serving, if possible by extracting the oil in front of everyone.
